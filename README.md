# Car-Damages
This project contains a flask application that detects damages in cars when a user uploads an image. In order to run the file, export the run_keras_server_edits-3.py file as a flask application. 

The Car_Damages.ipynb file contains all steps for training, testing and visualizing predictions made by the detection model when supplied with trianing and testing data. We have also used occlusion and saliency maps to determine areas that contribute most towards recognition and detection.
